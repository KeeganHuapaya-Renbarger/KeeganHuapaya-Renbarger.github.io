        <h3>Terminal Chess Game</h3>
        <p>This is a working chess game that you can play by entering moves and pressing enter or clicking the submit button.  This program started as a team project for UCI EECS 22L but I wanted to go farther with the project because I was interested in development so I took the terminal game that we created and made it playable on my website.</p>
        <iframe src="chess-backend/chess.html" class="chess-iframe" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        <p>Some of the main challenges were:
            <br> Getting the terminal colors to work (I used ASCII Escape codes for the original terminal game), 
            <br> Figuring out Emscripten (the converter that allowed my C language program to convert to .html, .js, & .wasm needed to run this terminal game), 
            <br> & Getting the correct spacing/font/padding to ensure the UI looks correct in the browser.
